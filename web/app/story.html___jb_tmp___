  Voting introduction. <br/>

  Perhaps you're looking at Sushi:<br>

  [[ Basic vote among candidates. ]]

  Describe: this is real data, collected as a survey of 5000 people on their sushi habits in Japan.
  As we can see, Sea Urchin is the pretty clear winner here. This is a bit odd don't you think? Sea Urchin is a very
  strong dish -- one might expect a more commonly liked fish like tuna would come out ahead.

  Let's take a deeper look. We'll need a bit more data though.

  [[ Basic vote spread by preference ]]

  // Understanding preference

  What if we let everyone rank the candidates by preference? I might prefer Shrimp the most, and find Tuna alright, but
  decidedly hate Salmon, so I'll rank that last.

  // allow users to add their own preference here for great good?

  This is what the same vote looks like with voter's preferences shown.  Here we have each candidate along with the
  number of people who placed the candidate at that position in their preference. Before we looked just at the 0 preference
  slot, or "how many people placed this candidate first in their list?".

  The results start to pick apart this puzzle. Tuna does tend to be well liked, with most people placing it in the top
  half of their list. Sea Urchin on the other hand tells a very different story. It turns out to be quite the extremist.
  A great deal of people placed Sea Urchin at the top of their list, but a great deal also placed it at the bottom! In
  fact, even **more** people ranked Sea Urchin in last place than first.

  And yet Sea Urchin won our first vote.

  It turns out that this system of voting (the most widely used system in the world) is just about one of the worst. It's
  technical name is Plurality Voting and it [doesn't] [have] a [great] [reputation]. It allows extremist candidates
  who even a majority of people may dislike to win elections.

  Voting systems aren't fixed in stone. What happens if we tweak it a bit?

  Right now, if you vote for a losing candidate, your vote essentially doesn't count. Instead let's count all of these
  *lost* votes towards the voter's second choice.  [[better description here]]

  With three candidates, this might look something like this:
  [[ Three candidate IRV demo ]]

  If we have more than 3 candidates, we'll do the same thing: eliminate the worst candidate and redistribute those
  voters to the rest.

  This look a lot better! One more thing. Candidates running in a plurality vote system are often plagued by "splitting
  the vote". If two candidates from the same party (or that are simply quite similar) run in the same race, they end
  up getting half of the vote, and making things worse for the both of them. This happens all the time. It's the reason
  Bloomberg didn't run for president, and one reason political parties strongly tend to elect a single candidate, even
  when the majority of the party disagrees with their views.

  Let's look at how each system handles this scenario in the extreme case. Click on a candidate to "clone" them, this adds a second
  with the exact same views to the race.

  It makes you wonder how we could ever trust Plurality at all.
