There's something very wrong with the political system in America. It's understandable to be a bit tired at this point.
Let's take a step back.

What if sushi ran for president, instead?

Luckily we don't have to dream &mdash; we have the data. In 2016, a researcher in Japan polled 5,000 people on
their sushi habits. Each person was asked to rank 8 sushi in order from best to worst.

<div id="voter_preference"></div>

To start, let's just have everyone vote once for their top choice.  [John note: show above graph with just the top row highlighted? ]

<div id="basic_vote"></div>

And the winner is! Sea Urchin?

This is a bit odd don't you think? Sea Urchin is a strong dish -- one might expect
a common fish like tuna to come out ahead.

Let's take a deeper look. We'll need a bit more data though. One vote per person just isn't enough.

## Understanding preference

What if we let everyone rank the candidates by preference? For instance, my sushi preference places Salmon and Shrimp
at the top and Cucumber and Egg at the bottom.

This is what the preferences of all 5000 voters looks like. Votes towards the left means voters placed that
candidate high on their list, votes on the right are from voters who placed the candidate at the bottom.

<div id="candidate_breakdown"></div>

The results start to pick apart this puzzle. Tuna does tend to be well liked, with most people placing it in the top
half of their list. Sea Urchin is a very different story. It turns out to be quite the extremist.
A great deal of people placed Sea Urchin at the top of their list, but a great deal also placed it at the bottom! __In
fact, even more people ranked Sea Urchin in last place than first.__

And yet Sea Urchin won our first vote.

It turns out that this system of voting (the most widely used system in the world) is just about one of the worst. It's
technical name is Plurality Voting and it [doesn't] [have] a [great] [reputation]. It allows extremist candidates
who even a majority of people may dislike to win elections.

Voting systems aren't fixed in stone. What happens if we tweak it a bit?

Right now, if you vote for a losing candidate, your vote essentially doesn't count. Instead, let's count all of
these lost votes towards the voter's second choice.

With three candidates, this might look something like this:

<div id="irv_three"></div>

If we have more than 3 candidates, we'll do the same thing: eliminate the worst candidate and redistribute those
voters to the rest.

<div id="irv_full"></div>

This look a lot better! This is called [Instant Runoff Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting).
If you place your primary vote for a candidate that doesn't win, your second and third votes get counted in the "run off"
elections after your primary candidate is eliminated.

One more thing. Candidates running in a plurality vote system are often plagued by "splitting
the vote". If two very similar candidates (perhaps from the same party) run in the same race, they each get half of the vote,
and make things worse for the both of them. This happens all the time. It's the
reason
Bloomberg didn't run for president, and one reason political parties strongly tend to elect a single candidate,
even
when the majority of the party disagrees with their views.

Let's look at how each system handles this scenario. Click on a candidate to "clone"
them. This adds a second candidate with the same view to the race (voters place this new candidate alongside the first in
their ranking). We'll start with our familiar plurality system:

See if you can get a winning candidate to lose, just by adding new candidates to the race!

<div id="basic_vote_cloning"></div>

Now how about with Instant Runoff Voting?

<div id="irv_full_cloning"></div>

It makes you wonder how we could ever trust Plurality at all.


/// thoughts
what are clones?
make the stages clearer between irv non-started and started irv
make it clear where human interaction is happening in IRV.
thinks that putting too many cloned choices at the top of the ballot might throw away those votes.
be clear: IRV does not allow throwing away your vote.
